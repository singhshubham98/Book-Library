# Book-Library

A desktop application aimed to manage library. The application was made using Bootstrap, Django and sqllite for Database. This was a personal project.
The main features that have currently been implemented are:

1) There are models for books, book copies, genre, language and authors.
2) Users can view list and detail information for books and authors.
3) Admin users can create and manage models. The admin has been optimised (the basic registration is present in admin.py, but commented out).
4) Librarians can renew reserved books
